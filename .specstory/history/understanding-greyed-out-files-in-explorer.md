_**Assistant**_

Let me help you check why your `base_model.py` file appears greyed out in the explorer. First, I'll check if the file exists and its status.

Let me check the contents and status of this file.

Read file: models/base_model.py

Let me also check if there are any git-related files that might affect the file's status.

Let me check for a `.gitignore` file as well.

Based on my investigation, there are a few potential reasons why your `base_model.py` file appears greyed out in the explorer:

1. **File is not tracked by version control**: Since I don't see a `.git` directory, this project doesn't appear to be under version control. However, some IDEs still show untracked files in grey.

2. **File might be excluded**: Even though I don't see a `.gitignore` file, your IDE might have its own exclusion settings that are causing the file to appear greyed out.

3. **File permissions**: The file exists and has content, but there might be permission issues affecting how it's displayed.

To resolve this, you can try:

1. Initialize git in your project if you want version control:
```bash
git init
git add .
```

2. Check the file permissions:
```bash
ls -l models/base_model.py
```

3. Check your IDE's file exclusion settings to make sure the file isn't being excluded.

Would you like me to try any of these solutions or would you like me to investigate something else?

I'll help you connect your project to GitHub. Let's do this step by step.

First, let me check if git is already initialized in your project.

I see git is already initialized and you have files staged for commit. Let's connect this to GitHub. Here's what we'll do:

1. First, let's create a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files:

---

_****_

```diff
- 
+ __pycache__/
+ *.py[cod]
+ *$py.class
+ *.so
+ .Python
+ build/
+ develop-eggs/
+ dist/
+ downloads/
+ eggs/
+ .eggs/
+ lib/
+ lib64/
+ parts/
+ sdist/
+ var/
+ wheels/
+ *.egg-info/
+ .installed.cfg
+ *.egg
+ .env
+ .venv
+ env/
+ venv/
+ ENV/
+ env.bak/
+ venv.bak/
+ .DS_Store
+ .idea/
+ .vscode/
+ *.db
+ *.sqlite3 
```

2. Let's create a proper README.md file:
